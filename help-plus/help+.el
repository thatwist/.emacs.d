;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to `help.el' for Emacs 22 and later.  For similar
;;    extensions to `help.el' for Emacs 20, see `help+20.el'.
;;
;;    Note: As of Emacs 24.4, byte-compiling this file in one Emacs
;;    version and using the compiled file in another Emacs version
;;    does not work.
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `help-on-click/key', `mouse-help-on-click',
;;    `mouse-help-on-mode-line-click', `pop-to-help-toggle'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `help-on-click/key-lookup'.
;;
;;  Internal variables defined here:
;;
;;    `help-origin-buffer'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `help.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `describe-key' (Emacs 22-25), `where-is'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The doc string for `help-for-help' has been
;;              REDEFINED HERE (see `make-help-screen help-for-help')
;;
;;  The following bindings are made here:
;;
;;    `C-h u'      `manual-entry'
;;    `C-h C-a'    `apropos'
;;    `C-h C-l'    `locate-library'
;;    `C-h RET'    `help-on-click/key'
;;    `C-h M-a'    `apropos-documentation'
;;    `C-h M-o'    `pop-to-help-toggle'
;;    `C-h C-M-a'  `tags-apropos'
;;    [mouse-1]    `mouse-help-on-click' (non-mode-line)
;;    [mouse-1]    `mouse-help-on-mode-line-click' (mode-line)
;;
;;  Suggested additional binding:
;;
;;   (global-set-key [f1] 'help-on-click/key)
;;

;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2017/10/21 dadams
;;     describe-key: Do not redefine for Emacs 26+ (not worth it).
;;     help-on-click/key-lookup: Use help--analyze-key, if defined, instead of describe-key.
;; 2015/07/02 dadams
;;     help-on-click/key: Removed part of doc string that said that C-g is not in manual index.
;; 2014/05/04 dadams
;;     Emacs 20-22: soft-require info+20.el (new) instead of info+.el.
;; 2014/04/22 dadams
;;     Updated for Emacs 24.4: with-help-window, not with-output-to-temp-buffer - bug #17109.
;;     help-on-click/key: save-excursion.set-buffer -> with-current-buffer.
;; 2012/08/21 dadams
;;     Call tap-put-thing-at-point-props after load thingatpt+.el.
;; 2012/08/18 dadams
;;     Invoke tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix if thingatpt+.el is loaded.
;;     help-on-click/key: Use tap-symbol-at-point, not symbol-at-point, if defined.
;; 2012/04/01 dadams
;;     where-is: Wrap individual key sequences in `', not just all of them together.
;; 2011/10/07 dadams
;;     Added soft require of naked.el.
;;     where-is, help-on-click/key-lookup: Use naked-key-description if available.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Removed autoload cookies from non-interactive function and define-key.
;; 2008-01-03 dadams
;;     describe-key: Replaced newline with ", " before "which is".
;; 2007/12/20 dadams
;;     pop-to-help-toggle = C-h M-o, so C-h C-o can be describe-option.
;; 2007/12/13 dadams
;;     Created.

KEY can be any kind of a key sequence; it can include keyboard events,
mouse events, and/or menu events.  When calling from a program,
pass KEY as a string or a vector.

If non-nil, UNTRANSLATED is a vector of the corresponding untranslated events.
It can also be a number, in which case the untranslated events from
the last key sequence entered are used.
UP-EVENT is the up-event that was discarded by reading KEY, or nil.

If KEY is a menu item or a tool-bar button that is disabled, this command
temporarily enables it to allow getting help on disabled items and buttons.

  "Give help on a key/menu sequence or object clicked with the mouse.
The object can be any part of an Emacs window or a name appearing in a
buffer.  You can do any of the following:

    type a key sequence (e.g. `C-M-s')
    choose a menu item (e.g. [menu-bar files open-file])
    click on a scroll bar
    click on the mode line
    click in the minibuffer
    click on an Emacs-related name in a buffer: apropos is called
    click anywhere else in a buffer: its modes are described

Help is generally provided using `describe-key' and the Emacs online
manual (via `Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node').  If no entry is found
in the index of the Emacs manual, then the manual is searched from the
beginning for literal occurrences of KEY.

If you click on a name in a buffer, then `apropos-documentation' and
`apropos' are used to find information on the name.  These functions
are not used when you do something besides click on a name.

If you click elsewhere in a buffer other than the minibuffer, then
`describe-mode' is used to describe the buffer's current mode(s)."
